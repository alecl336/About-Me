# About-Me
Containing config files for about me

I'm Alec Lu, currently a University of Sydney student studying Finance and Computer Science majors.
I'm interested in learning about machine learning (particularly their use in self-driving automobiles), cryptography, and mathematics.

I've had experience in utilising Python, Java, HTML + CSS, and JavaScript, and I am currently very excited to be learning more about algorithms.
A project I am currently working on is building a stock market trading game, where players makes moves round-based.
