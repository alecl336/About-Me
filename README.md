# About-Me
Containing config files for about me

I'm Alec Lu, currently a University of Sydney student studying Finance and Computer Science majors.
I'm interested in learning about machine learning (particularly their use in self-driving automobiles), cryptography, as well as the applications of artificial intelligence across diverse fields such as biology (Yes, a big fan of DeepMind's Alpha Fold) and finance.

I've had experience in utilising Python, Java, HTML + CSS, and JavaScript, and I am currently very excited to be learning more about algorithms.
